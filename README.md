This is the very beginning of what will be a better Winnipeg Transit app. It uses the Winnipeg Transit API (https://api.winnipegtransit.com/) for its datasource.

As of now, you can navigate the built-in map (Courtesy of MapLibre and OpenFreeMap), and look at route lists and nearby stops (currently hardcoded location)

The Trip screen is currently empty but will eventually have stuff(hopefully)

This is not a final product, and things will change as time goes on, including there being more screens and some UI changes.
