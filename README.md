This is the very beginning of what will be a better Winnipeg Transit app. For now, all of the data shown are hardcoded examples of for whats to come once the API is added.

As of now, you can navigate the built-in map (Courtesy of MapLibre and OpenFreeMap), and look at the example data in the other sections. 

The Trip screen is currently empty as I'll need to set up the API to figure out how I'm going to tackle it. 

This is not a final product, and things will change as time goes on, including there being more screens and some UI changes.
